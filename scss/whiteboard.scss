// Note this file should be used for themes only, do NOT use in conjunction with modifying UI/UX frameworks.
// To modify framework derived classes do so directly with the "{framework}.scss" import file and associated file.
// Frameworks provide a baseline for topography and styles for the most atomic parts of HTML markup semantics.
// The theme file is kept separate to apply more opinionated topography and styles to scaffold elements.
